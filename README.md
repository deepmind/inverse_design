The code here provides an implementation of the Encode-Process-Decode
graph network architecture in jax, model weights for this architecture trained
on the 3D WaterCourse environment, and an example of performing gradient-based
optimization in order to optimize a landscape to reroute water.

## Usage

### in a google colab
Open the [google colab](https://colab.research.google.com/github/deepmind/inverse_design/blob/master/demo_design_optimization.ipynb) and run all cells.

### with jupyter notebook / locally
To install the necessary requirements (run these commands from the directory
that you wish to clone `inverse_design` into):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/deepmind/inverse_design.git
python3 -m venv id_venv
source id_venv/bin/activate
pip install --upgrade pip
pip install -r ./inverse_design/requirements.txt
```

Additionally install jupyter notebook if not already installed with
`pip install notebook`

Finally, make a new directory within the `inverse_design` repository and move
files there:
```shell
cd inverse_design
mkdir inverse_design
mv src/ inverse_design/
```

Download the dataset and model weights from google cloud:
```shell
wget -O ./gns_params.pickle https://storage.googleapis.com/
dm_inverse_design_watercourse/gns_params.pickle
wget -O ./init_sequence.pickle https://storage.googleapis.com/
dm_inverse_design_watercourse/init_sequence.pickle
```

Now you should be ready to go! Open `demo_design_optimization.ipynb` inside
a jupyter notebook and run *from third cell* onwards.
